    "# Data Types and Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of individual columns and rows will impact analysis performed on a\n",
    "dataset read into python. For example, you can't perform mathematical\n",
    "calculations on a string (character formatted data). This might seem obvious,\n",
    "however sometimes numeric values are read into python as strings. In this\n",
    "situation, when you then try to perform calculations on the string-formatted\n",
    "numeric data, you get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will review ways to explore and better understand the\n",
    "structure and format of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn about character and numeric data types.\n",
    "* Learn how to explore the structure of your data.\n",
    "* Understand NaN values and different ways to deal with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "How information is stored in a\n",
    "DataFrame or a python object affects what we can do with it and the outputs of\n",
    "calculations as well. There are two main types of data that we're explore in\n",
    "this lesson: numeric and character types.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types include integers and floats. A **floating point** (known as a\n",
    "float) number has decimal points even if that decimal point value is 0. For\n",
    "example: 1.13, 2.0 1234.345. If we have a column that contains both integers and\n",
    "floating point numbers, Pandas will assign the entire column to the float data\n",
    "type so the decimal points are not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **integer** will never have a decimal point. Thus 1.13 would be stored as 1.\n",
    "1234.345 is stored as 1234. You will often see the data type `Int64` in python\n",
    "which stands for 64 bit integer. The 64 simply refers to the memory allocated to\n",
    "store data in each cell which effectively relates to how many digits it can\n",
    "store in each \"cell\". Allocating space ahead of time allows computers to\n",
    "optimize storage and processing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Character Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings, known as Objects in Pandas, are values that contain numbers and / or\n",
    "characters. For example, a string might be a word, a sentence, or several\n",
    "sentences. A Pandas object might also be a plot name like 'plot1'. A string can\n",
    "also contain or consist of numbers. For instance, '1234' could be stored as a\n",
    "string. As could '10.23'. However **strings that contain numbers can not be used\n",
    "for mathematical operations**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas and base Python use slightly different names for data types. More on this\n",
    "is in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pandas Type | Native Python Type | Description |\n",
    "|-------------|--------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| object | string | The most general dtype. Will be assigned to your column if column has mixed types (numbers and strings). |\n",
    "| int64  | int | Numeric characters. 64 refers to the memory allocated to hold this character. |\n",
    "| float64 | float | Numeric characters with decimals. If a column contains numbers and NaNs(see below), pandas will default to float64, in case your missing value has a decimal. |\n",
    "| datetime64, timedelta[ns] | N/A (but see the [datetime] module in Python's standard library) | Values meant to hold time data. Look into these for time series experiments. |\n",

    "in the future when you (or someone else) explores your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where Are the NaN's?\n",

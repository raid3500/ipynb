    "## About Libraries\n",
    "A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform\n",
    "tasks on our data. Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment\n",
    "out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench for use in a project.\n",
    "Once a library is set up, it can be used or called to perform many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas in Python\n",
    "One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the\n",
    "[Python Data Analysis Library](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (a.k.a. Pandas). The\n",
    "Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with\n",
    "[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and integrates nicely with other libraries\n",
    "that use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (which is another Python library) arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to\n",
    "add an `import` statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import\n",
    "a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the\n",
    "library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`.  An\n",
    "example of importing the pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we call a function that's in a library, we use the syntax\n",
    "`LibraryName.FunctionName`. Adding the library name with a `.` before the\n",
    "function name tells Python where to find the function. In the example above, we\n",
    "have imported Pandas as `pd`. This means we don't have to type out `pandas` each\n",
    "time we call a Pandas function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Overview\n",

    "We are studying the species and weight of animals caught in plots in a study\n",

    "# Reading CSV Data Using Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by locating and reading our survey data which are in CSV format.\n",

    "\n",
    "## So What's a DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different\n",
    "types (including characters, integers, floating point values, factors and more)\n",
    "in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or an SQL table or the `data.frame` in\n",
    "R. A DataFrame always has an index (0-based). An index refers to the position of \n",
    "an element in the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's make sure the Python Pandas library is loaded. We will import\n",
    "Pandas using the nickname `pd`.  This is a common convention on the internet,\n",
    "so if you look up Pandas usage, you will often see it this way.\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's also import the [OS Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html).\n",
    "This library allows us to make sure we are in the correct working directory. If\n",
    "you are working in IPython Notebook, be sure to start the notebook in the\n",
